<h3>The 4 Principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)<h3><br>

1. Encapsulation - defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the 
   mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. 
   Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield 
   that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.<br><br>
   
2. Abstraction - <br><br>

3. Inheritance<br><br>

4. Polymorphism<br><br>
