<h3>The 4 Principles of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)</h3><br>
<p>

1. Encapsulation - defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the 
   mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. 
   Another way to think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield 
   that prevents the data from being accessed by the code outside this shield.<br><br>
   
2. Abstraction - defined as displaying only the essential details to the user.
   The trivial or the non-essentials units are not displayed to the user.<br><br>

3. Inheritance - Inheritance is an important pillar of Object-Oriented Programming. 
   It is the mechanism in by which one class is allowed 
   to inherit the features(fields and methods) of another class. <br><br>

4. Polymorphism - The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define 
   polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in 
   more than one form.<br><br>

<h3><b>SOLID</b> Principles</h3>

1. S - Single Responsibility Principle:<br>
2. O - Open-Closed Principle:<br>
3. L - Liskov Substitution Principle:<br>
4. I - Interface Segregation:<br>
5. D - Dependency Inversion Principle:<br>
